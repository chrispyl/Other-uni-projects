## Simple ATM

The ATM accepts a magnetic card which contains a 4 digit code. The user enters his PIN, and if the PIN matches the code he can withdraw money. The user can choose the type and quantity of the paper money. For example if he wishes to withdraw 260 euro, he may want 1x100, 2x50, 3x20 paper money.
