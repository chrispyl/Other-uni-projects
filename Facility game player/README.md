##Facility game (2013-2014)

A two player game where we have a series of nodes each one having a number (points). The players play alternately and choose nodes to capture. When a node is captured its points are added to the player score. When three or more consecutive nodes belong to one player their score is tripled. The winner is the player with the most points.

The bot's name was **pancake**, and it came in the second place fighting the champions of the previous years and ours.
